**IArena** is an **open source** project that aims to provide a **simple** and **easy to use** framework for playing games in a manual or **automatic** way.
It is developed with educational and research purposes related with **computer science** and **artificial intelligence**.

========
Overview
========

**IArena** is a *Python* library that provides a framework for developing logic games and agents that play them.
The main idea is to be able to test strategies, algorithms and heuristics in different games.

Goal
----

The main goal of this project is to provide a framework for developing algorithms that are able to play optimally in different games.
A *player* is a piece of software that implements a simple interface that allows it to play following a game's *rules*.

Library
-------

The library is designed to be **extensible** and **easy to use**.
It is easy to add new games and agents, and to test them in different scenarios.
The games follow a series of interfaces for making scalable in order to test different agents in different games.

This library is mainly written in *Python*.
