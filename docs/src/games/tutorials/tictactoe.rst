The player that aligns 3 pieces of his color horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins.
If the board is full and no player has aligned 3 pieces, the game is a draw.

.. code-block:: python

  import IArena.games.TicTacToe.TicTacToePosition as TicTacToePosition
  import IArena.games.TicTacToe.TicTacToeMovement as TicTacToeMovement
  import IArena.games.TicTacToe.TicTacToeRules as TicTacToeRules


========
Movement
========

A movement is represented by 2 ``int`` representing the number of the row and the number of sticks:

- ``row``
  - ``int``
  - ``0 <= row < 3``
  - Index of the row to place the piece
- ``column``
  - ``int``
  - ``0 <= column < 3``
  - Index of the column to place the piece

.. code-block:: python

    movement = TicTacToeMovement(
      row=1,
      column=1)
    # Place in the middle of the board


========
Position
========

A position is represented by a ``list`` of ``list`` of ``int`` describing the board.
Each position is represented by an integer, ``0`` for empty, ``1`` for player 1 and ``2`` for player 2.

.. code-block:: python

  # position : TicTacToePosition
  x = position[0][0]        # Player in the top left corner
  if x == 0:
    # Empty cell
  elif x == 1:
    # Player 1
  elif x == 2:
    # Player 2

  board = position.board
  x = board[0][0]        # Player in the top left corner
