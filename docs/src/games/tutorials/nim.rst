Import
======

.. code-block:: python

  import IArena.games.Nim.NimPosition as NimPosition
  import IArena.games.Nim.NimMovement as NimMovement
  import IArena.games.Nim.NimRules as NimRules


========
Movement
========

A movement is represented by 2 ``int`` representing the number of the row and the number of sticks:

- ``line_index``
  - ``int``
  - ``0 <= line_index < N``
  - Index of the line to remove sticks
- ``remove``
  - ``int``
  - ``0 < remove < Ni``
  - Number of sticks to remove from the line (must be less than the number of sticks in the line)

.. code-block:: python

    movement = NimMovement(
      line_index=2,
      remove=1)
    # Remove 1 stick from the 3rd line


========
Position
========

A position is represented by a ``list`` of ``int`` describing each row:

.. code-block:: python

  # position : NimPosition
  len(position)      # Number of rows
  position[0]        # Number of sticks in the first row

  lines = position.lines
  len(lines)         # Number of rows
  lines[0]           # Number of sticks in the first row
