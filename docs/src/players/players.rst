Players

The final goal of this project is to be able to create software that can play a specific game.
This software is called **player** and must implement the **IPlayer** interface.

=======
IPlayer
=======

The interface can be found in ``src/IArena/interfaces/IPlayer`` module.

This interface is used by an *arena* to play a specific set of rules.
The only method that must be implemented is ``play``.
It receives an ``IPosition`` and must return an ``IMovement`` (specific movement depending on the rules playing).

.. code-block:: python

    def play(
            self,
            position: IPosition) -> IMovement:
        pass

The constructor of an ``IPlayer`` is not defined.
Each implementation could have its own constructor, adding for example a name, the rules of the game, etc.

-----
Rules
-----

The rules of each game are available from each ``IPosition`` of the game by calling ``position.get_rules()``.

---------
Movements
---------

Choose the next movement is responsibility of the player.
Each game has different movements that require different parameters.
Depending on the game, the player must create a movement with the required parameters.

However, in the rules of the game there is a method ``possible_movements`` that returns a list of possible movements.
The player can create its own movement or choose one from the list of possible movements.

.. code-block:: python

    from IArena.interfaces.IPlayer import IPlayer
    from IArena.games.Hanoi import HanoiRules, HanoiMovement, HanoiPosition

    class MyPlayer(IPlayer):

        def play(
                self,
                position: HanoiPosition) -> HanoiMovement:

            # Create next movement from scratch
            movement = IMovement(...)

            # Choose one from the list of possible movements
            rules = position.get_rules()
            possible_movements = rules.possible_movements(position)
            movement = possible_movements[...]

            # Return the movement
            return movement


-----
Arena
-----

In order to play a game with an autonomous player, an *arena* is required.
An *Arena* is a class that implements the loop of the game, or the context in which the game is played.
For further information, see the :ref:`arena` module.

The easiest arena to use is ``GenericGame`` that implements a single loop over the game and make each player play in its turn.
If you prefer to see step by step the game playing by the player, use ``BroadcastGame``.

.. code-block:: python

    from IArena.arena.GenericGame import GenericGame  # or BroadcastGame
    from IArena.games.Hanoi import HanoiRules

    rules = HanoiRules()
    my_player = MyPlayer()

    arena = GenericGame(
        rules=rules,
        players=[my_player]
    )
    score = arena.play()


=================
Multiplayer games
=================

In games with more than 1 player, you would need another player to play against.
There are several generic players implemented, please check :ref:`random_player`.


.. code-block:: python

    from IArena.arena.GenericGame import GenericGame  # or BroadcastGame
    from IArena.games.Coins import CoinsRules, CoinsMovement, CoinsPosition
    from IArena.players.players import RandomPlayer

    rules = CoinsRules()
    my_player = MyPlayer()
    other_player = RandomPlayer()

    arena = GenericGame(
        rules=rules,
        players=[my_player, other_player]
    )
    score = arena.play()

You may want to repeat the game several times to get a better score.
For this purpose just use a loop and accumulate the score.

.. code-block:: python

    from IArena.arena.GenericGame import GenericGame  # or BroadcastGame
    from IArena.games.Coins import CoinsRules, CoinsMovement, CoinsPosition
    from IArena.players.players import RandomPlayer

    rules = CoinsRules()
    my_player = MyPlayer()
    other_player = RandomPlayer()

    score = 0
    for _ in range(50):
        arena = GenericGame(
            rules=rules,
            players=[my_player, other_player]
        )
        score += arena.play()

    for _ in range(50):
        arena = GenericGame(
            rules=rules,
            players=[other_player, my_player]
        )
        score += arena.play()

    print(score)


================
Heuristic Player
================

Other way to create a player is to give a heuristic for a position, rather than a movement.
The already implement player ``HeuristicPlayer`` does check every possible future position,
by trying every possible movement in a position,
and calculates the score of the position by the method ``heuristic``.
Then, it decides the movement with the lower heuristic.

.. code-block:: python

    from IArena.arena.GenericGame import GenericGame  # or BroadcastGame
    from IArena.games.Hanoi import HanoiRules, HanoiMovement, HanoiPosition
    from IArena.players.HeuristicPlayer import HeuristicPlayer

    class MyPlayer(HeuristicPlayer):

        def heuristic(self, position: HanoiPosition) -> float:
            # Add code to calculate the heuristic of the position
            return 0.0

    rules = HanoiRules()
    my_player = MyPlayer()

    arena = GenericGame(
        rules=rules,
        players=[my_player]
    )


.. note::

    Remember that the best movement is the one with the lowest heuristic.

Multiplayer game heuristic player
---------------------------------

One thing to take into account is that creating an heuristic for a multiplayer game,
the heuristic must be calculated as the position given is the one that the opponent will play.
Because the positions in which it applies are the next ones, and not the current ones.
