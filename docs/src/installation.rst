Google Colab
============

Using :ref:`Google Colab <https://colab.google>` is the easiest way to get started.
Just add in the first cell of your notebook:

.. code-block:: python

    # Download and install latest version of the package
    !pip install git+https://github.com/jparisu/IArena.git

    # Or to download a specific version
    !pip install git+https://github.com/jparisu/IArena.git@v0.2

This will install the specific version of the package and make it available in the rest of the cells of your notebook.
